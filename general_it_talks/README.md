- Here its a list of the most amazing talks i watched on youtube about general IT. 


## [How to Speak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY&ab_channel=MITOpenCourseWare)
- *A talk that was a tradition for 40 years at MIT*. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Winston)\
Prof. Winston clearly explains some ***"heuristic rules"*** to keep in mind when giving "public talks" or simply "talking".
Talk to take into account when ***"exposing"*** technical issues.



## [Frankenbuilds; if Agile is so Good, why are our Products so Bad?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JNXx8VdbAE&ab_channel=GOTOConferences)
- This talk was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012. 
A talk by ***Gabrielle Benefield*** on how teams can get more value on the *production/development* of products. 
More or les the basic concept expresed here it's: 

**"The need of *integrate or listen* each and every member of the company in 
one way or other in te process of building a product and the importance of 
the *know how* the final user uses the product you're making."**

Offers a view on how the process of **"feature delivery"** with no order o 
control mechanism it's bad for bussines and  the planet in the sense of:

*"Features that take long time and computational efforts to produce and no one 
take the time to see if users like it. Cost a lot of time, energy and money."*
